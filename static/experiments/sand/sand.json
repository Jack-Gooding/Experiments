  "description": "This is a demonstration of the 'Sandpile' experiment, a different way of showing Self Organised Criticality. This is the traditional interpretation, and produces some very interesting patterns, although they do take a significant time to process. <br/><br/> This differs from my other 'Sandpile' in that it does not behave as a typical sandpile does, only stacking to four grains high before cascading to the surrounding pixels.",
