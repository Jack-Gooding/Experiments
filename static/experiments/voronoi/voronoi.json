  "description": "A Voronoi / Delaunay generator. The delaunay triangulation of a set of points is first calculated using the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm'>Bowyer-Watson alogorithm</a>, and a Voronoi diagram is then generated by joining the circumcenters of any adjacent triangles. <br/><br/> The basic principle of the Delaunay triangulation is to first create a superTriangle to encompass all points, then for each point determine which triangle circumcenters a point is within, remove these triangles and create a new subset of triangles from the leftover edges.",
