  "description": "The Trapped Knight, is a mathematical problem. The scenario is based on an infinite chess board, at the centre of which begins a numbered spiral, counting up. A knight piece is placed at the start of this spiral, and will may move as usual except for two rules; the knight may only move to the lowest square it can reach, and it may not move onto a square it has already visited.",
